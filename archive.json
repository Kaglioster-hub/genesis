Found at unusually high frequencies in both modern and ancient populations, the gene likely provided immune advantages against new pathogens. This research highlights how archaic DNA, passed through both Denisovans and Neanderthals, enriched human genetic diversity in ways that still shape us today.</p><p><a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250824031538.htm' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>🔗 Fonte</a></p></details><details><summary><h3>New fossils reveal a hidden branch in human evolution</h3></summary><p>Fossils unearthed in Ethiopia are reshaping our view of human evolution. Instead of a straight march from ape-like ancestors to modern humans, researchers now see a tangled, branching tree with multiple species coexisting. Newly discovered teeth reveal a previously unknown species of Australopithecus that lived alongside some of the earliest Homo specimens nearly 2.8 million years ago. This suggests that nature tested multiple versions of “being human” before our lineage endured.</p><p><a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250821094509.htm' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>🔗 Fonte</a></p></details><details><summary><h3>Ancient fossil discovery in Ethiopia rewrites human origins</h3></summary><p>In the deserts of Ethiopia, scientists uncovered fossils showing that early members of our genus Homo lived side by side with a newly identified species of Australopithecus nearly three million years ago.

Multiple interbreeding events with distinct Denisovan populations helped shape traits like high-altitude survival in Tibetans, cold-weather adaptation in Inuits, and enhanced immunity. Their influence spanned from Siberia to South America, and scientists are now uncovering how these genetic gifts transformed human evolution, even with such limited physical remains.</p><p><a href='https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250814090949.htm' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>🔗 Fonte</a></p></details><details><summary><h3>A 16-million-year-old amber fossil just revealed the smallest predator ant ever found</h3></summary><p>A fossilized Caribbean dirt ant, Basiceros enana, preserved in Dominican amber, reveals the species ancient range and overturns assumptions about its size evolution.
